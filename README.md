## RPG-Quest: Firebase Cloud Functions / Backend

This is the repo for my cloud functions (hosted on firebase) that will serve as the backend for my game

[Here's the Front-End](https://github.com/nstranquist/RPG-Quest-Part2)

### Functions:  
- getPlayer()  
- updatePlayer()  
- getAllMonsters()  
- getRandomMonster()  
- getAllFormulas()  

### Future Goals:
- CRUD with more advanced data  
- test the functions/database with larger quantities of data  
- Integrate with Redux and Redux Persist on the frontend  
- **Add triggers for notifications, formulas, and more**
